Required: libxml-dev

Assuming <yourapp> is the root dir of your app.

===== Get DPDK

Required packages for Ubuntu to install DPDK: libpcap-dev gcc libc6-dev libxml2-dev (DO NOT INSTALL libc6-dev-amd64, installs i386 for some reason...)

Download DPDK sources to <DPDK>.

# Is the following necessary????:
# Add the -fPIC option in <DPDK>/mk/target/generic/rte.vars.mk:
# -CFLAGS += $(TARGET_CFLAGS)
# +CFLAGS += $(TARGET_CFLAGS) -fPIC

Change config/common_linuxapp:

CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_SHARED_LIB=y
CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y
This way, a libdpdk.so is created under <DPDK>/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/lib/.

Build the DPDK with:
make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc

Go to the directory grt/.
Change RTE_SDK and RTE_TARGET in the Makefile accordingly.
Hit "make".

Go to the directory <yourapp>/.
Change RTE_SDK and RTE_TARGET in the Makefile accordingly.
Hit "make".
